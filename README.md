Overview
--------

Freeciv-Web consists of these components:

* [Freeciv-web](freeciv-web) - a Java web application for the Freeciv-web client.
  This application is a Java web application which make up the application
  viewed in each user's web browser. The Metaserver is also a part of this module.
  Implemented in Javascript, Java, JSP, HTML and CSS. Built with maven and runs 
  on Tomcat and nginx.

* [Freeciv](freeciv) - the Freeciv C server, which is checked out from the official
  Git repository, and patched to work with a WebSocket/JSON protocol. Implemented in C.

* [Freeciv-proxy](freeciv-proxy) - a WebSocket proxy which allows WebSocket clients in Freeciv-web
  to send socket requests to Freeciv servers. WebSocket requests are sent from Javascript 
  in Freeciv-web to nginx, which then proxies the WebSocket messages to freeciv-proxy, 
  which finally sends Freeciv socket requests to the Freeciv servers. Implemented in Python.

* [Publite2](publite2) - a process launcher for Freeciv C servers, which manages
  multiple Freeciv server processes and checks capacity through the Metaserver. 
  Implemented in Python.

Freeciv 3D
-------------
Freeciv 3D is the 3D version using the Three.js 3D engine, which requires WebGl 2 or WebGPU support.

Running Freeciv-web on your computer
------------------------------------
The recommended and probably easiest way is to use Docker. Freeciv-web can also be run with WSL. In some cases it may be easier.

Check out Freeciv-web to a
directory on your computer, by installing [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and
running this command:
 ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/fciv-net/fciv-net.git --depth=10
 ```

You may also want to change some parameters before installing, although
it's not needed in most cases. If you have special requirements, have a look
at [config.dist](config/config.dist),
copy it without the `.dist` extension and edit to your liking.



All software components in Freeciv-web will log to the /logs sub-directory of the Freeciv-web installation.


### Running Freeciv-web on Docker

Freeciv-web can easily be built and run from Docker using `docker-compose`.

 1. Make sure you have both [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

 2. Run the following from the freeciv-web directory:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

 3. Connect to docker via host machine using standard browser

http://localhost:8080/

Enjoy.

Start and stop Freeciv-web with the following commands:
